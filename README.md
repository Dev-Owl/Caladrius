CouchDB Admin UI using Flutter, the goal is to:
* Get insides on Flutter Web
* Build an "complex" app that can run with one code base on multiple platforms
* Have something that doesn't loose the session... (Fauxton...)
* Allow to run from any Server (learning about CORS)

Right now included:

* Cookie login from ANY location (if CORS is configured in CouchDB) for Web and App
* See a list of all DB's

Next app:

* Basic functions like Fauxton offers
